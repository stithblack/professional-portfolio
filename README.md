# Professional Portfolio

## Description
This web application is a portfolio page that includes some information about myself and some of the projects I have completed. It utilizes HTML and CSS to provide a responsive experience and was an opportunity to develop something from scratch. Some concepts I practiced while working on this project include wireframing and flexbox.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
